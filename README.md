Since the growing number of people suffering from mental health problems has limited opportunity to have psychological treatment, chabots research has paid much attention as a ubiquitous means to exhibit effective psychological support. However, it is not clear how and why the chatbots determine such supportive content to provide, which significantly diminishes the trust and efficacy. Thus, we propose a novel deep generative model which delivers circumstantial information in the generation of the treatment content.

Emotional supportive chatbot creates emotional conversations in response to the user's input conversation. At this time, the rationale for the response generation of the chatbot is predicted and presented together with emotional conversation. The model primarily generates emotionally supportive dialogue in response to the user input, whilst it infers the type of user‚Äôs emotion, its intensity and the treatment strategy as a rationale. These three information are presented as explainbale information for chatbot conversations, forming a system that can explain the emotional supportive content of the chatbot.

The chatbot, along with dialogue, outputs emotion for the sentence by user input and the strategy used by the chatbot to provide emotional support to the user. For emotion classification on the user input, we included all sentences with ESConv, an Emotion Supportive Conversation dataset, labeled as one of 12 emotions for all texts based on the *emotion_type* provided by ESConv. In addition, in order to output the emotional intensity of the user input, the user input was used as the test data of the Neutral Emotion Intensity Prediction to output the emotional intensity of the four emotions (Anger, Sadness, Fear, Joy).

We trained and run each model of **Emotion Supportive Chatbot** and **Neutral Emotion Intensity**. It is shown below how to run each model.

## Neutral Emotion Intensity Prediction
### To successfully and smoothly run our experiments, please follow the steps below - 

1. Collect all the dialogues of user inputs and Head to *XAI-Emotionally-Supportive-Conversations/Neutral_Emotion_Intensity_Prediction/data/test* directory.
2. You will see a total of 4 files in *eval(anger, pear, joy, sadness).txt* in the current directory.
3. If you open a file(ex: *evalanger.txt*), you can see that there are sentences in the second column, and replace them with all the dialogues of user inputs. Note that you need to replace the user inputs from the top, and the rest should be the original set length. (Reference Code: ~) Repeat for all 4 files.
4. Head to *XAI-Emotionally-Supportive Conversations/Neutral_Emotion_Intensity_Prediction* and follow the instructions in that README to number 5.
5. Run *codes/Multi_task/LE_PC_DMTL_EI_Demo.py* to see the intensity of each of anger, pear, joy, and sadness. At this time, `y_pred_(anger, pear, joy, sadness)` at the end of the code can be checked by using `print` as many as the number of user inputs.(ex:`print(y_pred_joy[:10])` )
